Flow mapping was conducted around the MUAS using smoke flow visualisa-tion and multi-hole pressure probes to analyse the effects of the propellers on the measured flow speed and direction and determine a suit-able mounting location for an on-board multi-hole pressure probe sensor system. It was de-termined that propeller-induced effects extended beyond a feasible on-board probe length.

@article{VanBoxel2004,
abstract = {Fast-response wind and turbulence instruments, including sonic anemometers, are used more and more in aeolian sediment transport research. These instruments give information on mean wind, but also on fluctuations and turbulent statistics, such as the uw covariance, which is a direct measure of Reynolds' stress (RS) and friction velocity. This paper discusses the interpretation of sonic anemometer data, the transformations needed to get proper results and turbulence spectra, and how they are influenced by instrument size, sampling frequency, and measurement height. Turbulence spectra characterize how much the different frequencies in the turbulent signals contribute to the variance of wind speed, or to the covariance of horizontal and vertical wind speed. They are important in determining the measurement strategy when working with fast-response instruments, such as sonic anemometers, and are useful for interpreting the measurement results. Choices on the type of sonic anemometer, observation height, sampling period, sampling frequency, and filtering can be made on the basis of expected high and low-frequency losses in turbulent signals, which are affected by those variables, as well as wind speed and atmospheric stability.Friction velocity and RS, important variables in aeolian sediment transport research, are very sensitive to tilt or slope errors. During a field experiment, the slope sensitivity of the RS was established as 9{\%} per degree of slope, which is 1.5 times the value reported in literature on the basis of theoretical considerations. An important reason for the difference probably is the large influence of streamline curvature on turbulence statistics and thereby on the slope sensitivity of the RS. An error of 9{\%} per degree of slope in the RS will translate into an error of approximately 4{\%} per degree of slope in the calculated friction velocity.Space-time correlation of the horizontal wind speed is much larger than that of the vertical wind speed and the instantaneous RS. This largely explains why, in previous studies, a poor correlation was found between instantaneous RS measured at 3 m height and saltation flux near the surface, whereas the correlation between wind speed at some height and saltation flux was much better. Therefore, the poor correlation between RS away from the surface and saltation flux does not contradict that saltation flux is caused by RS. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract. Originally designed for atmospheric boundary layer research, the MASC (Multipurpose Airborne Sensor Carrier) RPA (Remotely Piloted Aircraft, also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, UAV) is capable of making in-situ measurements of temperature, humidity and wind in high resolution and precision. The autopilot system ROCS (Research Onboard Computer System) enables the aircraft to fly pre-defined routes between waypoints at constant altitude and airspeed. The system manages to operate in wind speeds up to 15 m s−1 safely. It is shown that a MASC can fly as close as one rotor diameter upstream and downstream of running wind turbines at these wind speeds and take valuable data of incoming flow and wake. The flexible operation of an RPA at the size of a MASC can be a major advantage of the system compared to tower measurements and remote sensing in wind energy research. In the project "Lidar Complex" comparisons of RPA measurements with lidar systems and tower measurements are carried out at two different test sites. First results, including turbulence and wake measurements, from a campaign in autumn 2013 are presented.},

@techreport{Hansen1998,
abstract = {The forcings that drive long-term climate change are not known with an accuracy sufficient to define future climate change. Anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs), which are well measured, cause a strong positive (warming) forcing. But other, poorly measured, anthropo-genic forcings, especially changes of atmospheric aerosols, clouds, and land-use patterns, cause a negative forcing that tends to offset greenhouse warming. One consequence of this partial balance is that the natural forcing due to solar irradiance changes may play a larger role in long-term climate change than inferred from comparison with GHGs alone. Current trends in GHG climate forcings are smaller than in popular ''business as usual'' or 1{\%} per year CO 2 growth scenarios. The summary implication is a paradigm change for long-term climate projections: uncertainties in climate forc-ings have supplanted global climate sensitivity as the predominant issue.},

The system is highly flexible and has the capability for in-situ ABL measurements with unique spatial and temporal resolution. SUMO is based on a light-weighted styrofoam model airplane, equipped with an autopilot system for autonomous flight missions and in its recent version with meteorological sensors for temperature, humidity and pressure. With its wingspan of 80 cm, its length of 75 cm and a total lift-off weight of 580 g, SUMO is easy to transport and operate even in remote areas with limited infrastructure. During several field campaigns in 2007 and 2008 the system has been successfully tested and operated. Atmospheric profiles of temperature, humidity, wind speed and wind direction have been determined up to 3500 m above ground during the FLOHOF (FLOw over and around HOFsj{\{}{\"{o}}{\}}kull) field campaign in Central Iceland in July/August 2007. During a 3 week campaign on and around Spitsbergen in February/March 2008 the SUMO system also proved its functionality under polar conditions, reaching altitudes above 1500 m even at ground temperatures of {\&}{\#}8211;20° C and wind speeds up to 15 m s. },

It is applicable to inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and magnetic angular rate and gravity (MARG) sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion compensation. The algorithm uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. Performance has been evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the algorithm achieves levels of accuracy matching that of the Kalman based algorithm; {\textless} 0.8° static RMS error, {\textless} 1.7° dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at small sampling rates significantly reduces the hardware and power necessary for wearable inertial movement tracking, enabling the creation of lightweight, inexpensive systems capable of functioning for extended periods of time.},

abstract = {Using integrated sensors carried onboard a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can be used to wind field estimation through intelligent dynamic analysis, UAV control, and sensor management. The data from UAV on-board sensors such as GPS and inertial measurement units are utilized such that no dedicated sensors (i.e., pitot tube) for wind characterization are necessary. Using the estimated ground weather conditions, the UAV performance provides a means for rapid wind field estimation. The motivation is to develop an agile and low-cost atmospheric measurements system for energy harvest and realtime mission support. The advantage of UAV versus weather balloons is the agility of the UAV to operate in constrained environments and complex terrain. The wind profile is calculated by applying algorithms that relates the attitude of the aircraft to the local wind speed and direction, sparing the payloads of external devices like multi-hole tubes. Several existing wind field estimation algorithms are evaluated and compared with the proposed Kalman Filter dynamic behavior fusion using data obtained from the wind sensors as well. Error analysis and the reasons of errors are discussed in the estimation process. The proposed UAV-based on-board avionics system can be used to improve positioning accuracy and flight stability in the spatially varying, turbulent wind circumstances.},

@misc{Gmbh2010,
abstract = {a b s t r a c t Mist-rooted 'Picual' olive cuttings were used to test the hypothesis that both the amount of nitrogen applied and the nutritional status of olive plants may affect nitrogen uptake efficiency (NUE). Plants were placed in a greenhouse at 30/15 • C (day/night) with a 14 h photoperiod. Two different experiments were developed. In the first, plants were subjected to the application of 0, 50, 100, 200, 400, 600 or 800 ppm N. In the second experiment, the aim was to obtain three groups of plants differentiated by the nutritional status. Each group received 0, 50 or 100 ppm N, according to the results obtained in the first experiment. When plants of each group differed in their nitrogen content, they were subjected to additional nitrogen application either via foliar or to the soil. At the end of each experiment, plants were harvested and nitrogen was determined in leaves, stems and roots to obtain the nitrogen uptake by the plants. Nitrogen uptake efficiency (NUE) was estimated as NUE = (N uptake/N applied) × 100. Nitrogen content of the plant, vegetative growth and leaf chlorophyll content increased from 0 to 100 ppm N applied, decreasing at higher doses of N application. Consequently, NUE exponentially decreases with the amount of N applied above 100 ppm, with values ranging from 45.9{\%} at 100 ppm to 4.1{\%} at 800 ppm N. The method of nitrogen application, foliar or to the soil, does not affect nitrogen uptake, but the contrary occurs with the nutritional status of the plant. Nitrogen deficient plants were able to uptake more fertilizer nitrogen that well-nourished plants, with a significant reduction in NUE. Consequently systematic, annual applications of large amounts of fertilizer nitrogen may cause nitrogen over-fertilization and negative effects in both the plant and the environment.},
