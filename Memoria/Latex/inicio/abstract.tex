Enviromental pollution is a really serious problem nowadays. There are many fields of study to fight pollution, one of them is atmosphere gases analysis and their behavior. A real important factor for that analysis is to know where they come from and where they go, the cause of that movement is the wind, becoming a main factor for the gases study.

The main goal of this study is the wind and its study through a sensorization system installed on a mobile platform, this system has been atached on a quadcopter, a drone with 4 motors. The data acquisition is similar to the expected results and show the good functioning of the created sensor; the movement and the force of the wind or its absence can be showed through the data representation.

The use of this wind measure system is the basic complement for a potential gas measuring sensor, helping it to try achive a solution for enviromental pollution.
